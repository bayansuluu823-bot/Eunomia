Offline inventory system project
This project is an offline inventory system designed to track physical assets
such as equipment, tools, and components.
The system is intended for use in colleges, labs, workshops, or small
organizations without cloud services.
The main goal of the system is to clearly show:
- what items exist
- where they are located
- whether they are available or in use
