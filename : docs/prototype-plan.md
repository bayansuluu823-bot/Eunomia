First Prototype Plan – EUNOMIA

Prototype Goal
The goal of the first prototype is to visualize the core structure and logic of
the EUNOMIA inventory system.

The prototype will demonstrate how users interact with inventory data without
implementing backend logic or databases.

Target Users
- Admin (responsible for managing inventory)
- Staff (can view and update item status)
- Viewer (can only view inventory information)

Core Screens
- Inventory list
- Item details view
- Add / edit item form (conceptual)
- Status overview (available, in use, broken)

Prototype Format
The prototype will be created as a UI/UX design prototype using Figma.
No programming or backend implementation is planned at this stage.

Development Steps
1. Define system structure and user roles
2. Create user flow and navigation logic
3. Design low-fidelity wireframes
4. Design high-fidelity UI screens in Figma
5. Review and refine based on feedback

Expected Outcome
A clear and interactive visual prototype that demonstrates the concept and
usability of the EUNOMIA offline inventory system.
